**Privacy Policy**

Grekov Software built the "Share Contact" app as an Ad Supported app, called further as a Service.
This Service is provided by Grekov Software at no cost and is intended for use as is. 

This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this Service. 

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. Data collection refers to the local access to this data and its processing on the user's device. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 


**Information Collection and Use**

When using this Service, we may require you to provide access to certain personal information, including, but not limited to, contacts.

The application reads device contacts data (contact names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses) to ensure the operation of its main functions: deleting or transferring contacts to other applications on the device. The described functions can be carried out solely on your initiative, as a user of the application, while you independently determine the amount of such data.

The requested information will not be collected by us in any way.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
